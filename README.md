This folder contains our work, along with Mokhles Bouzaien for the Algorithmic Machine Learning course at Eurecom. 

The course consisted of 3 real life use cases of data science. 

Grading was based on the quality of presentation and the creativity of approaches.

For a quick overview of our work, please check the .html files as they are more thouroughly expalained.

If files are too big for github you can download-them and read them using your favourite navigator.
